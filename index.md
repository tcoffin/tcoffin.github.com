# Tyler!

I'm Tyler and this is my github page. I'm a software developer. Just a developer, no one specific speciality. I think specialization in database design, java or any other small subset of computing sounds pretty dull. Therefore I try to learn new langauges, tools and approaches regularly. As much as possible I try to put experiments and useful bits up on github, however I do work full time so that doesn't happen as often as I'd like (I do contribute _all_ the time to projects at work; if only I could get some git-credit for that!)
