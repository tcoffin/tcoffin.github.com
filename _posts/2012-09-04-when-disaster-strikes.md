title: When disaster strikes
---
One of the former companies I have worked for was one that made enterprise backup software. The first day of training consisted of being shown my workstation, being given a Solaris workstation, given CVS access and a document on how to build the product (building the product was not straight forward between poorly documented environment variables and a codebase that had to pulled from a CVS server on the other side of the continent over a slow WAN link). After I had it built and installed, I used the software to do a full system backup on to a tape drive. I reported my success to my mentor. He sat down at my workstation, then proceeded to delete some important system files and the backup software. "Your server has just crashed. You had a backup right?"  
  
Thus began my first lesson in to disaster recovery.  
  
Are you ready?
